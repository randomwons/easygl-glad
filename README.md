# easygl-glad
The easygl-glad library is designed to simplify resource management in OpenGL, making the process of creating and deleting various resources more straightforward. Developed for **educational purposes**, this library aims to streamline the process and reduce the complexity involved in managing OpenGL resources.


Much of the code in this library is inspired by and built upon the resources available at https://github.com/rinthel/opengl_course.
